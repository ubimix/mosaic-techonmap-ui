== NEW: Implement an embedded view of the map
== NEW: ? In desktop mode center the map in the visible area
Takes into account the size of the size of the right panel (360px)
see : https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/859

== TODO : dynamicly add url to sharing link (twitter, facebook, linkedin, viadeo) in the opened startup panel.

== CORRECTED ** BUG: Top menu covers the map
It seems that the map fills the full screen and the top menu bar covers a part 
of the map. It leads to the following bugs:
* When a popup associated with a map marker can be covered by the top menu.
* Zoom controls (+/-) are not visible 
Possible solution: re-calculate the size of the map canvas 

== CORRECTED ** BUG: Bad resizing of the right panel
1. Search by the mask 'agor'. It shows two results: 'Agoranov' +
'Incubateur du Centquatre'
2. Open the 'Agoranov' entry
Bug: it is impossible to scroll the list to the next entry
Reason: it seems that the vertical size of the scrollable area are
not calculated as expected after the entry resizing.

== CORRECTED ** BUG: Content of wrapped search panel is replaced by selected points
1. Wrap the right panel 
2. Select a point on the map
Bug: The content of the search criteria box is replaced by the currently selected 
point.
Reason: Content is scrolled to the selected point even if the right panel is wrapped
